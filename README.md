Here will be your React project with authorization and registration. Use your previous work on the Mesto project. It can be the work of the 11th sprint or its improved version after the last 2 sprints.

All requests for authorization, registration and token verification must work through the https://auth.nomoreparties.co service. Other requests not related to this project work may be for the backend from previous sprints.
