# Project: Mesto-React-Auth

Mesto - an interactive page where you can register users, add photos, delete them, and like them. All requests for authorization, registration and token verification work through the `https://auth.nomoreparties.co service`.

The project is written in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JSX` using `React Fraemwork`. To building the SPA was used the `BEM` methodology. Data came from the server and was sent to it through a class component using `RestAPI`.

You can run use:
```
npm run start
```
